## About me
 My name is **Adriana Kuczaj** and I am currently a student at the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw. My specialization is IT in Business.

 In addition to my studies, I also try to pursue various courses and workshops to develop my knowledge and programming skills.

## Project aim
 This page was created as part of a training to remember the material from the online course I am a participant of. The course was created by **YouCode** - Internet Programing School.

## How to use website
On the website you can read and learn more about what BMI is and calculate its value for our body by providing the appropriate parameters.

In the future, I plan to expand the website even more and change the graphic design.

## Demo
Check out how it works :)
